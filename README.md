Flow charts with JavaScript function.

Think of all the possible outcomes from each step.

Think of how you would do the task if it was your job to do the function in real life.

Write down all the steps.

Once you have managed to think of how a human might do the task. You then need to try think how you might do this as a computer.

Then follow the flow chart and create the function step by step.

You will run into issues and things might not work out exactly how you want it to but then you need to again think like a computer and think of all the JavaScript methods which could be used here.
